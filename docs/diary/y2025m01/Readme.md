Zhifeng: moving the "demographic" page prior to player ID allocation. Adding developer utilities to skip data submissions.

# Jan. 20th

Zhifeng: implementing the game interface.

Zhifeng: now, the game is generally playable. I will add the survey pages next.

# Jan. 19th

Zhifeng: Start implementing the game interface and logic.

# Jan. 18th

Zhifeng: implemented the Condition construction process: with a given condition ID, I can now construct that condition with all the scenarios, cards, and survey questions information.

# Jan. 17th

Zhifeng: cleaned AI player card data.

# Jan. 12th

Zhifeng: cleaned player card data. I'm going to clean the AI players and then, finally, the conditions.

# Jan. 9th

Zhifeng: cleaned "Scene" related information. The players and AI players' card distribution and AI's "strategy" for the same scenario are different from "case" by "case," and one condition is an experiment regarding the same case on different scenarios. (I guess.) I will start to clean the players and AI players' card distribution and AI strategy information next.

# Jan. 5th, 2025

Zhifeng: I started working on cleaning game source data like cards and conditions, cleaning name entries typos like 'S!T1' (should be 'S1T1'), and parsing these names into separate columns.

# Jan. 2nd, 2025

Zhifeng: From the tail of Dec. 2024, I was working on polishing the server-side state management and client-side state update. The two-player "proof-of-concept-ish" game logic seems to work smoothly now, and the client-side refresh doesn't break anything.
