### Defining Conditions

Since the conditions are constant, I'm planning to remove them from the database and only using on-memory conditions to make the process simpler.

### Server State

Since the "room id" and "player id" are all randomly generated, I'm worried that there might be id collisions. I'm planning to add a system that keeps track of the total number of created rooms and players.

The current server state design is a bit unusual. I wonder why we need to separate things mapped from "room id" into multiple maps, instead of using one map.

I'm worried that the current logic of "assignroom" is troublesome, considering two users joining at the same time.

### Http Post Endpoints

I found the logic of files in the controller folder is completely identical. So, I grouped them in one file.

### Issue: duplicate database connection

It seems we have a "query" in "proj_root/src/config.ts" and a "DbUtil" in "proj_root/src/utils/dbUtil.ts".
