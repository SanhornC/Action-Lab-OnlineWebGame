# November Week 2

Zhifeng has been focusing on writing documentation and trying to build a client-server communication pattern, such as how the server side should update the client page after receiving the other player's action.

## Nov. 18th, 2024

Zhifeng worked on the organizing and unify implementation terms like useing `PlayerStateSer` to represent the serialized version of player state, separating from the server-side actual `PlayerState` containing other server-side information.

Zhifeng designed a client-server communication pattern so that the server can actively update the client-side page with the web socket. He managed to make a small testing module that allows the developers to send multiple numbers to the server and verify if the numbers are correctly tracked in the server runtime structure (currently).
