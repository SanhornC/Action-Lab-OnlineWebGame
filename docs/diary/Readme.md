Zhifeng: From the tail of Dec. 2024, I was working on polishing the server-side state management and client-side state update. The two-player "proof-of-concept-ish" game logic seems to work smoothly now, and the client-side refresh doesn't break anything. Zhifeng is planning to implement the board-game room-initialization logic, along with the loading of static information like the card contents and room types.

Zhifeng has been testing the validity of his design idea on server-client communication and trying to find the project's best, most sustainable, and most readable implementation practice.
